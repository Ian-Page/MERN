MERN fullstack make your folders
    server - This is your backend server / project folder and will hold all server related files
        config - will handle the database configuration and connection
        controllers - will hold all logic for each model (i.e creating, updating, etc...)
        models - will hold all the schemas
        routes - will handle all of our routes for each model
        server.js - will handle all the server logic with express

Once you have created the server.js file and the folders, open a new terminal window and navigate into your project folder (labeled as server in the image above) and install the server dependencies by running:

npm init -y
npm install mongoose express
echo "node_modules">> .gitignore


make sure you intall npm init  and mongoose express from server root
Client root folder is the react npm start...open 2 terminals. cd to each directory server /client
